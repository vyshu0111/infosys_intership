Hey,communicating only through GitHub is a bit confusing and not very smooth for our project discussions. If you’re all okay with it, we can create a WhatsApp group and share updates there—it’ll be faster and easier to coordinate

#cmtdivyansh - vyshnavi if you can share your mail id i can create a gmail space where we can chat without sharing phone no.
i have created one with pooja's mail id
